# Virtual Tour Component Documentation

This guide will help you integrate a 3D GLB model (for example, a virtual tour of a real estate property) into your Next.js website using react‑three‑fiber and Drei. You'll learn how to overcome server‑side rendering (SSR) issues, load assets correctly, and set up a polished 3D scene.

## Introduction

Integrating 3D models into modern web applications can create engaging, interactive experiences. In real estate, a virtual tour component allows users to explore properties in a 3D environment. However, due to browser-specific APIs (like WebGL) and Next.js' server-side rendering (SSR) behavior, extra care is needed when building such components.

---

## Prerequisites and Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js and npm/yarn:** Installed on your development machine.
- **Basic knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript and React:** Familiarity with React fundamentals.
- **Understanding of Next.js:** How pages and dynamic imports work.
- **A GLB file:** Your 3D model (for example, your virtual tour asset).

Additional helpful knowledge includes familiarity with three.js and its ecosystem. For more background, see [this Stack Overflow discussion]().

---

## Project Setup

### Step 1: Creating a New Next.js Project

Use the Next.js CLI to bootstrap a new project:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-virtual-tour
cd my-virtual-tour
```

If you want to use TypeScript or other configurations, follow the CLI prompts. (For a detailed guide on integrating 3D models with Next.js, see [this Medium article]().)

---

## Installing Dependencies

Install three.js along with react‑three‑fiber and Drei (a helper library):

```bash
npm install three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei
# or if using yarn:
yarn add three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei
```

These libraries let you work declaratively with three.js in React and provide helpers (e.g., for loading GLB files) that simplify your code.

---

## Directory Structure and Asset Placement

Place your GLB model inside the `public` folder. For example, if your model is named `virtual-tour.glb`, place it in:

```
my-virtual-tour/
├── public
│   └── models
│       └── virtual-tour.glb
```

This allows you to reference the file in your code via a URL such as `/models/virtual-tour.glb`. Proper asset placement prevents issues like "Failed to parse URL" during production builds ([Stack Overflow discussion]()).

---

## Configuring Next.js for Client‑Only Components

Since three.js relies on browser APIs, you must ensure the 3D component is rendered only on the client side. There are two common approaches:

### 1. Using the `"use client"` Directive (Next.js 13+)

Place the directive at the top of your component file:

```jsx
"use client";
import React from "react";
// ... rest of your imports
```

### 2. Dynamic Import with SSR Disabled

If you're using an older Next.js version or prefer dynamic imports, wrap your 3D component as follows:

```jsx
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";

const VirtualTour = dynamic(() => import("../components/VirtualTour"), {
  ssr: false,
});

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Virtual Tour</h1>
      <VirtualTour />
    </div>
  );
}
```

This method disables server-side rendering for the component, ensuring that it runs only in the browser ([Reddit discussion]()).

---

## Building the Virtual Tour Component

Let's create a detailed 3D component that loads your GLB model, sets up a scene, and adds interactive controls.

### a. Creating the 3D Scene

Using react‑three‑fiber, you create a scene with the `<Canvas>` component:

```jsx
"use client"; // ensure the component runs only in the browser

import React, { Suspense } from "react";
import { Canvas } from "@react-three/fiber";
import { OrbitControls } from "@react-three/drei";
import Scene from "./Scene";

export default function VirtualTour() {
  return (
    <div style={{ width: "100vw", height: "100vh" }}>
      <Canvas camera={{ position: [0, 2, 10], fov: 50 }}>
        {/* Ambient lighting for overall illumination */}
        <ambientLight intensity={0.5} />
        {/* Directional light to create shadows and depth */}
        <directionalLight position={[5, 10, 7.5]} intensity={1} castShadow />
        
        {/* Use Suspense to wait for the model to load */}
        <Suspense fallback={null}>
          <Scene modelPath="/path/to/your/model.glb" />
        </Suspense>
        
        {/* Enable orbit controls for interactive navigation */}
        <OrbitControls />
      </Canvas>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### b. Loading the GLB Model

Create a separate component to load the model using Drei's `useGLTF` hook:

```jsx
"use client";

import React, { useMemo } from "react";
import { useGLTF } from "@react-three/drei";
import { MeshToonMaterial, Color } from "three";

export default function Scene({ modelPath }: { modelPath: string }) {
  // Reference the model by its public URL
  const { scene, materials, nodes } = useGLTF(modelPath);

  // (Optional) Customize materials after load if needed:
  useMemo(() => {
    // For instance, replace a material with a MeshToonMaterial for a stylized look:
    const greyLevel = 0.06;
    const customMaterial = new MeshToonMaterial({ color: new Color(greyLevel, greyLevel, greyLevel) });
    if (materials["MaterialName"]) {
      materials["MaterialName"] = customMaterial;
    }
  }, [materials]);

  return <primitive object={scene} />;
}

// Preload the model for improved performance
useGLTF.preload(modelPath);
```

Here, the `useGLTF` hook loads the GLB file asynchronously, and the `<primitive>` element injects the loaded scene into the Canvas. You can customize materials and node properties using `useMemo` once the asset is loaded.

### c. Adding Lighting and Controls

To enhance the 3D experience, add various lights and camera controls. We already added ambient and directional lights. Additional options include:

- **Point Light:** For localized highlights.
- **Spot Light:** To create dramatic shadows.
- **Environment Maps:** Use Drei's `<Environment>` component to add realistic reflections and ambient lighting based on HDR environments.

Example with an environment preset:

```jsx
import { Environment } from "@react-three/drei";

// Inside your <Canvas>:
<Suspense fallback={null}>
  <Scene modelPath="/path/to/your/model.glb" />
  <Environment preset="city" />
</Suspense>
```

This enriches the scene with an urban light environment, which can be useful for real estate tours ([Medium tutorial]()).

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. SSR and Asset Loading Errors

- **Error:** `TypeError: Failed to parse URL from /models/virtual-tour.glb`  
  **Solution:** Ensure the model is placed in the `public` folder and that your component renders only on the client (use `"use client"` or dynamic import with `ssr: false`). ([Stack Overflow]())

### 2. Model Appears "Broken" or Not Rendering Properly

- **Cause:** Three.js code running during SSR or an incorrect asset path can break the build.  
  **Solution:** Verify that all browser‑dependent code is wrapped in client-only components and that your asset URL (e.g., `/models/virtual-tour.glb`) is correct.

### 3. Missing Colors or Textures

- **Cause:** Some GLB files may use legacy extensions or require material conversion.  
  **Solution:** Convert materials from spec/gloss workflows to metal/rough if needed. You can use online tools (e.g., [gltf.report](https://gltf.report/)) to check and export the model in the correct format ([three.js forum discussion]()).
